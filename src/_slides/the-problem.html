        Good Food provides nourishment and enables people to thrive, is
        produced in a manner that is environmentally regenerative, comes
        from a supply chain in which no one was exploited, and is equitably
        accessible to all.
      </p>
      <p class="p-fade-in editable">
        Good Food should be the norm, not the exception. Good Food exists in
        local and regional food systems, yet those systems are small,
        decentralized, inefficient, and inconsistent.

        <strong>
          The demand for Good Food is there; the sophisticated Good Food
          supply chain is not.

          To us, good food is more than local, it is: transparently sourced,
          nourishing to both body and mind, ethically raised, and harvested
          in an environmentally conscious way. Most of all, good food is
          equitably accessible to all people, regardless of who they are or
          where they live.
