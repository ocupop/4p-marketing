            The geographic challenge of availability to resources and access to
            Good Food based upon location. For example, no grocery stores within
            a reasonable distance.

              We stock the YBA’s weekly Field of Greens market, the only
              year-round farmers’ market in Ward 7, with healthy and local
              produce from our network. (2,000+ lbs of food were distributed
              Q1-Q2 2019).

            The personal access challenge is about lifestyle and environmental
            limitations. For example, someone working multiple jobs may not have
            the time, tools or knowledge to buy and prepare healthy food.
