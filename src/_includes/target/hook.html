          <p>4P defines &ldquo;good food&rdquo; as something more than just local. To us, good food is: transparently sourced so you know where it came from, healthy to nourish both body and mind, ethically raised with no souls exploited in its production, and harvested in a way that maintains the health of the environment. Most of all, good food is equitably accessible to all people, regardless of who they are or where they live.</p>
          <p>At 4P, we believe in a world where good food is the rule&mdash;not the exception. And every day, we get a little closer.</p>
