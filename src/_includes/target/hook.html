          <p>4P defines "good food" as something more than just food that's geographically accessible. To us, good food is also transparently sourced, dense in nutrients, seasonally appropriate, ethically raised, and produced with regenerative agricultural practices. Good food honors, respects, and compensates all living beings in its chain of development for the value they contribute. At 4P, good food gives back.</p>
